# ProteinOrtho_Curves2

Thanks @isabelschober for developing such meaningful code.

I have optimized the code by using multiple threads to run iterations and improved the speed of individual threads.

Additionally, I have added a grouping feature that now allows the species in the proteinortho output results to be divided into two groups, enabling visualization of the differences in the pan-genome and core genes between the two groups. 

Now you can use --groups to input a list where the first column contains species names (which must exactly match those in output.proteinortho), and the second column specifies their corresponding groups.
